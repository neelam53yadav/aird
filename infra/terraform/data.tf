# Data sources to reference existing resources
# Note: These are optional and won't cause errors if resources don't exist
# They're useful for referencing existing resources in outputs or other resources

# Note: Terraform's state management handles idempotency automatically.
# If a resource exists in state, Terraform will skip creation.
# If a resource exists but not in state, you should import it.
# See import.tf.example for import commands.
